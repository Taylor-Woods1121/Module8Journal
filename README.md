What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  The problem I was trying to solve with the program was to make sure there was a menu people could access to find the proper course information.
  
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  I first tried to understand the outcome that was expected, then I went into the 24/7 tutor to help me not only with the code itself, but to make sure it's understood properly but to make sure there was no silly mistakes. 
  
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  I joined the 24/7 tutor service as much as I could. Most of my free time after work was working with a tutor.
  
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  I still have a lot to learn about coding. It can be very overwhelming for me and I feel like online classes expect perfection out of just reading from a book for a week. I would benefit more from live class seminars once a week, especially with someone like code.
  
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I am definitly getting better with picking up on small errors like syntax that can bring up an error from such a simple thing. I also feel like my code has got neater and I'm using more in line comments than I was before.
